   Chemical potential
     *symbol*: :math:`\mu`--
     *units*: energy/particle

     *Definition*: The potential that a substance has to produce in order to 
     alter a system. It is defined as: :math:`\mu \equiv -T (ds/dN)`

     

   esat
     *symbol*: :math:`e_s` --
     *units*: :math:`Pa`  -- 
     *Notes*: `vapor notes`_ --  
     *Text*: p. 80-82

     *Definition*: Otherwise known as the saturation vapor pressure.
     The pressure exerted by the water vapor at the point of
     saturation.  Saturation is defined when the rate of
     condensation is equal to the rate of evaporation.

   enthalpy
     *symbol*: :math:`H` --
     *units*: :math:`J`  --
     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ --
     *Text*: p. 95-96

     *Definition*: A measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system.

   entropy
     *symbol*: :math:`s` --
     *units*: :math:`J kg^{-1} K^{-1}`  -- 
     *Notes*: `entropy and equivalent temperature notes`_, `Clausius-Clapeyron notes`_ --  
     *Text*: p. 95-97 and 100-101 (has a more general take on entropy)

     *Definition*: A measure of the randomness or disorder in a system.

   equivalent potential temperature
     *symbol*: :math:`\theta_e` --
     *units*: K --
     *Notes*: `entropy and equivalent temperature notes`_ -- 
     *Text*: p. 85

   helmholtz free energy
     *symbol*: :math:`f` --
     *units*: :math:`J`  -- 
     *Notes*: --  
     *Text*: p. 111

     *Definition*: Thermodynamic potential that measures the 
     "useful" work obtainable from a closed thernodynamic system
     at a constant tempreature and volume.

   helmholtz free energy
     *symbol*: :math: `f` --
     *units*: J --
     *Text*: p 111 (see also any statistical or thermal physics text book)

     *Definition*:  :math:`f \equiv u - Ts` where u is the internal energy, T is
     the temperature and s is the entropy (see above definition). When 
     considering energy conservation of one or more systems at a constant 
     temperature it is more useful to look at the Free Energy rather than the
     Internal Energy.

   internal energy
     *symbol*: :math:`u` --
     *units*: J/kg --
     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ -- 
     *Text*: p. 72

     *Definition*: Kinetic and potential energy of a system's molecules and
     atoms (doesn't count the kinetic energy of the system moving
     as a unit, or the potential energy due to movement in an
     external gravitational or electromagnetic field)

   moist static energy
     *symbol*: :math:`h_m` or :math:`h_{mse}` --
     *units*: :math:`J kg^{-1}`  -- 
     *Notes*: `moist static energy notes`_
     *Text*: p. 86

   quadratic degree of freedom
     *Definition*: A degree of freedom is quadratic if the energy terms 
     associated to this degree of freedom can be written as:
     E = :math:`aX^2 + bXY`
     Where the square on the X term indicates the quadratic degrees of 
     freedom. This means that they system has two degrees of freedom.

   potential energy
     *symbol*: :math:`U` --
     *units*: :math:`J` --
     *Notes*: `internal energy notes`_ (mentioned) --
     *Text*:  --

     *Definition*: The energy stored in a system as a result of their
     position based on their frame of reference.

   virtual temperature

     *units*: :math:`K` --
     *Notes*: `vapor notes`_ --
     *Text*: p. 66

     *Definition*: The temperature of dry air at t7he pressure and
     density of a sample of moist air.

   virtual potential temperature
     *symbol*: :math:`\theta_v` --
     *units*:`K` --
     *Notes*: `vapor notes`_ --
     *Text*:  --

     *Definition*: The potential temperature of dry air at the density
     of a sample of moist air.`


   wet-bulb temperature
     *symbol*: :math:`\theta_w` --
     *units*: K --
     *Notes*: --
     *Text*: p. 83-84

     *Definition*: A temperature measurement that reflects the
     physical properties of a system with a mixture of air and water
     vapor. It is the lowest temperature that can be reached by the
     evaporation of water only.  `

     *Definition*: Otherwise know as the saturation mixing ratio. 
     The ratio of the mass of saturated water vapor over mass of dry air.
     i.e. :math:`e_{sat}/p_{dry}`

   geopotential height
     *symbol*: :math:`Z` --
     *units*: :math:`km`  -- 
     *Text*: p. 69

     *Definition*: A vertical coordinate adjusted from geometric 
     height(elevation from mean sea level) based on the variation
     of gravitational potential.
